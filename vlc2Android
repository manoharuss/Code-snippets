##Please save this python script in the same folder
##as your VLC or Windows Media playlist, you want to convert



##Read in the file with format extension
with open ("INPUT_VLCplaylist_HERE.m3u", "r") as myfile:
    data=myfile.read().replace('\n', '')

##SPlit it into multiple pieces in X datatype ''list'
x=data.split('\Music')
boom=data.split('\Music')
##This a temporary string to account for split part
direct="\\Music"

##This pops out the first item in X list which is the extension VLC uses
p = x.pop(0)

it=len(boom)

##Whatever playlist name you change here is going to show in your Android phone
text_file = open("Output_Android_Playlistname_HERE.m3u", "w")

##The loop splits each string in X and takes the mp3 directory,adds \Music upfront and writes into the .m3u file

count = 0
while (count < it-1):
   p = x.pop(0)
   temp1=p.split('#EXT')
   temp1=temp1.pop(0)
   line=direct + temp1
   text_file.write(line)
   text_file.write("\n")
   count = count + 1

text_file.close()

##This is not the most efficient but I welcome your suggestions.
